Thank you for visiting my website!

My name is Suzuka. I’m a Japanese. I want to improve my English, so I started an English diary.

My dream is to get a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from an American university. I want to learn it as it will also be useful for my work.

My hobbies are programming, playing the piano, composing, reading books, playing video games, and so on.

I will try my best to write this in correct and natural English, please tell me if I have made a mistake.

Thank you.
