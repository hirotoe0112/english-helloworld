Thank you for visiting my website!

My name is Suzuka, and I am Japanese. I love English so much that I couldn't resist expressing my ideas in English after I started reading English books.

I am now studying at the University of the People, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Times New Roman is designated in the university, so this website is written in that font.

I like reading English books, as I mentioned previously, and learning IT subjects and other fields in English, playing the piano, composing, and so on in my spare time.

Since I will try to write this correctly and naturally, please let me know if I have made a mistake.

Thank you.
