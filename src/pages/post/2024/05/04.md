Lately I'm listening to music which I made on SoundCloud during studying kanji. I like to play music at random, but I noticed only the paticular songs are played. Today I found the reason. The old songs are placed at bottom of the list, so they aren't loaded. Once I loaded all the songs and played at random, the old songs were played. I'm going to load all the songs first the next time I study kanji.

Today I was studying kanji, as usual. It takes too much time to study kanji. I had also planned to study Russian, signal processing, generative AI, and so on before Golden Week started, but I couldn't study anything but kanji. I'm a little irritated. Time is passing too fast.

I feel a bit tired with studying. I want to play the game, without worrying about anything... But if I do so, I will strongly regret. Now, I have had dinner. After writing this diary, I will restart to study. As far I don't decide what to study. But I have to study anything, because time is passing too fast... My partner is watching an anime now, which makes me feel a bit envy.
