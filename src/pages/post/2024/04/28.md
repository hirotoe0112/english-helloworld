I'm embrassed... The title of yesterday's diary was wrong...

This morning I had an online meeting with a student of the university from which I graduated. I answered several questions about the company I'm working at.

I also practiced typing with Russian keyboard layout. The website which I always use was something wrong, so I used another website.

In the afternoon, I went to the piano circle to which I belong. It was held in Nagakute and I played Sonatine No.1 by Siberius. There was a bakery near the practice room, where I purchased a buget, a matcha bread, and a chocolate ring bread. I'm going to eat the baget for dinner. I'm looking forward comparing the taste with the breads I've eaten.

Totally I was tired. I want to eat dinner, watch a movie, and read "The Cobra Event" the rest of the day. There were a lot of gross scenes in the book, but I'm really excited and thrilled. Actually, I happened to see the spoiler, so I have already knew the name of villain and who are going to die... But the book is really interesting so I can't put it on.
