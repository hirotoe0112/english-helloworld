title: Learning Russian in English

Thursday, 18 April 2024

Lately I like learning something in English, so I started watching a video about Russian in English. But a problem occured. In that video, there is no script! I can't listening English completely, I struggled to understand what a teacher said. But I managed to learn Russian arphabet and basic pronounciation. Russian pronounciation is difficult for me Japanese. But I aim to read Russian books, so perphaps I don't have to worry about pronounciation very much.

Today I absolutely didn't want to make dinner. The motivation wasn't occured. But finally I reluctantly made it. I have to make more effort to do daily chores.

Anyway, it is Friday tomorrow. I want to rest.
