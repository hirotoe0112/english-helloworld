title: How can I improve my English?
---

Friday, 19 April 2024

Even though I am reading a lot of English books, listening audio books in English, watching videos in English, I still no good at English, which makes me frustrated. When can I read English books smoothly, listen to English completely?

Today I came up with an idea for my blog. I'm going to write a blog related to Nagoya, in which I will advertise a session introducing my company. I have struggled to come up with the idea for several months. I have to construct the details of the blog and post it by this weekend.

Lately I strangely eager to eat scones. In Wednesday, I had it for lunch. Yesterday, I also did. And today, too. I feel like I take too much sugar, so I have to reduce its amount for my health.
