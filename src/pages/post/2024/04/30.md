Tuesday, 30 April 2024

I can't believe that April is over... Time is passing very fast...

Today I went to my office. Before I went to, I freezed several breads which I purchased last Sunday. I had some of them for breakfast and lunch, which were very delicious.

I use GitHub Copilot to develop, which predicts the sentences that I'm going to type. During development it is very useful, but during writing diary in English, I can accidentally see what it predicts. I have the rule that I don't retrieve the spelling and the grammer during writing diary, that is inconvinient a bit. To prevent from seeing, I can't ever look at the display! I'm writing this looking at the wall.

After I returned home, I had dinner. Then I studied kanji as usual. The textbook says that if you scored less than 99, you had better give up... But I won't give up. If I continue making efforts, I would pass the exam, probably.

And I studied Russian. Today I learned Russian handwriting, which seem to be too complex. By whether there is a first stroke or not, it means different letters. I can't understand. But for Russian, perhaps Japanese is also incomprehentive.
