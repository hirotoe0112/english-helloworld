Today I watched a movie of "Detective Conan" at a theater. I hadn't been to a theater for a long time. The movie was so exciting, and after the ending, I felt missing a little.

After the movie, I had a hanburg for lunch at a restaurant near the theater. It was covered with curry sauce and cheese. Even though its caroly was very high, I was satisfied with the lunch.

Then, I went to a glossary to buy meals of dinner. I purchased some sasimi, chawanmusi, and kamaboko. Because the lunch was oily and salty, I wanted to eat healthy foods for dinner.

After I came back home, I studied kanji. I tried the second practice exam in the textbook. I got 96 scores, however the passing line of the exam is 160. Is it possible for me to pass the exam?

At night, I made word lists of Russian. I wanted to use an app to manager word lists, but I don't want to install a new app because my smart phone would be messy. So I decided to use Notion, a memo app I already use. This app has some issues when using with smart phone..., but so far, I'm goint to continue using it.

It is time for dinner, but I'm not hungry. If I have dinner so late, the time I go to bed will be also late. I have to have dinner immediately.
