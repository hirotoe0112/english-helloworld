Last Thursday, I had an exam about Google Cloud. Because I did that in English, I was very nervous. As a result, I did pass. I was very relieved. I would like to challenge exams in English as long as I can.

Next two days, I traveled to Chiba. It is anually event that I and my partner stay at a hotel where he loves. This time we stayed in high grade room, where meals were very delicious and special. We were very satisfied with that travel.

Yesterday, I was very tired because of the travel. I was sleeping and playing the game all day. I started the game about Sangokushi. Because of that, I became interested in Sangokushi.
