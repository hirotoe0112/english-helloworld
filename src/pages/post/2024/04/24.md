Wednesday, 24 April 2024

In this morning, in my neighborhood, a building was under destruction. The sound was like the earth is groaning or roaring, which made me very scared. Will that happen tomorrow? I want it to end soon.

I would go to my office today, but I was too sleepy to wake up by the time when I usually leave. Besides, it was raining. I should go to bed earlier so that I can wake up early. But in order to keep the rule I had set that I read The Cobra Event 20 pages per day, I have to read it late night(I know this expression is wrong, but I don't know what to say)

Today out team had a scrum event, which is hold every Wednesday. I was assigned to several tasks. I have little time to do them this week, which makes me a little nervous.

After work I was studying Kanji, and I have finished the first textbook. This is only the beginning of the long roadmap of studying Kanji. I bought next textbook. In addition to that, I bought two Russian textbooks. They are written in English. I'm looking forward to studying Russian in English.
