I'm stuck. The speed of my reading English books is slow down. Now I'm reading The Cobra Event by Richard Preston, which is a little difficult for me. The previous book of it was very easy to read, so I expected this book is also easy. But there are too many unknown words and the structure of the sentences are complicated. I decided the rule that I read this book 20 pages per day, which so far I'm able to keep. But I will struggle soon.

Today my colleague and I dealt with a difficult task. Hardly I could help him enough, but I did what I could do. Tomorrow we will have a scrum event and I will be assigned a new task. Is it true that the more tasks I deal with, the more my skills advance?

I'm practicing typing with Russian keyboard order. I almost memorize where each keys are, but I can't type proactively as well as English keyboard order. However, I'm not supposed to type Russian so long text, so perhaps I don't need to worry about it.
