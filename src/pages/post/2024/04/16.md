Tuesday, 16 April 2024

Today I went to my office. I spent most of time to deal with the tasks with my pair. Fortunately, we could open a pull request, so the rest of the task is being reviewed and fixing. This is normal day before the scrum event.

I'd like to study Russian language, because I'd like to read Russian books in original language. After I started to read English books, I realized that reading foreign books in original language is very delightful. I hope I can read Russian books as well. But I have studied English for more than 20 years. I'm not sure if I can do the same thing about Russian.
