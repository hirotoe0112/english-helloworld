Monday, 3 April, 2024

It was a day of scrum event of my project team, which the members of project reported weekly outcome to product owners. Also I attended to retrospective, which the member of project looked back last sprint and discuss how to improve the way of development. We have these events every week, so we are able to deliver out product to customer rapidly.

And today my partner who live with me was a little sick, so he was absent from working. His condition now became good, so we are going to have curry for dinner.

My tasks of this sprint are a little difficult for me...so I'm nervous. I don't have capability of doing all of tasks out project should do.
