I obtained a book about English writing which I ordered yesterday. Japanese people can usually read English well, but as for writing, quite a few Japanese would make mistakes. They, including me, write English sentences the way they write Japanese sentences. These sentences are likely to sound unnaturally for native English speakers.

The book instruct how to write natural English sentences. For example, Japanese people often use the phrase "there is...", but English people use other phrases, which are more natural, to express the same meaning. The author show the readers a lot of similar examples. The book will lead my English writing skill to the next level.

I'm not going to take a TOEFL exam, but I will study English as if I took it. The reason of that is that it may be the best way to improve my English skills such as reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Having high skills will make me easier to read English books and English articles, which I sometimes need to read at work, and watch online sessions held in foreign countries. My whole life will be more enjoyable with high level English skills. Therefore, I will keep studying.
