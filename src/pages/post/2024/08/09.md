I'm prone to being influenced by the surrounding people. Therefore, I tend to do what they expect to me rather than what I want to do. When someone questions me what I want to eat, I can't help but think "Well, I want to eat a ramen, but he/she may not want to eat it..." I have had this portrait since I was a child. Now, I don't know what I really want and want to do. I'm suffered from this. How can I restore my real desire?

I was graded high when I was a student. This doesn't necessarily mean that I'm smart. Obtaining high score on the paper tests is different from acting as a good social person. Parents are bothered with their children's grades, but I insist that the grades were definitely not relevant to their children's social success. Although high-graded children are likely to success, it merely happen by chance. I want parents to focus on children's indivisual personality and to respect their desire. Studying at a school is just a part of humanity life.

I may regret my life. I had a lot of turning points in my life, and I think I made a best choice at each point. However, were they really right? I don't think so.
