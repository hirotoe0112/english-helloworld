Tuesday, 19 March, 2024

It was cold, although it is spring.

I went to my office today. My weekly tasks have almost done. So I spend much time to study.

Recently, I have high motivation about studying. I want to study for example math, kanji, AI, IoT, and more. But I don't have enough time to do those all. How should I do? How can I do?

By the way, I want to eat cakes. Too much.
