I finally pre-entered UoPeople. The reason for "pre" is that I won't be permitted to enter if I can't meet English proficiency. Anyway, as a pre-entered student, I started my first term.

One of the most impressive things about my first two days in college is that the students who have financial difficulty and live in difficult situations in their countries have incredible passion and motivation for learning. I'm ashamed of my laziness despite living peacefully in a no-war country and being able to have enough food. I decided to commit my learning and make a great effort to improve my computer and English skills.

I'm not good at insisting on my opinion. However, as a college student, I must clarify and convey my thoughts to others. I expect that the training lead me to urge my thoughts in the business scene.

So far, I enjoy my learning. I have already finished several assignments, but I have three challenging tasks. I am eager to improve my English reading and writing skills through this course.

By the way, in my business life, I must learn many things, such as Google Cloud, new programming languages, and cloud technology. It's more important that I use the time effectively.
