I'm trying to keep studying for 25 hours each week, but so far, I failed. I could do it for over 20 hours, yet I couldn't reach 25 hours. I am prone to be lazy on weekends, especially on Sundays. I will start college next week, so I must study much harder.

I tried writing this diary with Grammarly, though I always do with Visual Studio Code because I want to improve my English composition by myself. OpenAI revises my grammar mistakes and makes clarity better. I want to at least correct grammar mistakes by myself, even though I can't enhance fluency. Grammarly can correct grammar and spelling mistakes. I want to see what OpenAI says when I write a no-mistake diary.

Recently I have been learning English composition. I understand how to write like English speakers and how Japanese speakers are prone to write unnatural sentences. However, when I try to write, my writing is not completely smooth. Why can't I write phrases like the way English people do? Why can't I conceive anything, although, in Japanese, I can have some ideas? Why do I make grammar and spelling mistakes forever? Perhaps practices are needed. So I'm going to keep writing a diary.

Can I graduate from the American college that I plan to enter? I get worried...
