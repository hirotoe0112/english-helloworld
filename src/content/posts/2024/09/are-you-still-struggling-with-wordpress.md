WordPress causes us a lot of pain, even though it is quite a convenient tool. Is it the best tool for constructing a blog site? The answer is definitely no for particular people, including me. Then, what is the alternative? I migrated this blog to Astro, and the way of building it and the new writing process satisfied me.

Of course, WordPress is a CMS, which is the acronym of a content management system. The familiar graphical interface lets you write, edit, and delete the articles. The tremendous themes provided by the developers enable you to change the blog's design quite easily. On the other hand, Astro is a static site generator. It allows you to define the structure of the blog, and once you build it, a series of static files, such as HTML and CSS, are generated. Then, you can upload these files on your web server through FTP software.

One of the advantages of Astro is flexibility. WordPress is, so to speak, like a package you can customize. Its capability limits your creativity. However, you can build a blog from scratch with Astro because the underlying elements are merely HTML files. You can design whatever you want and create whatever pages you want. Your creativity is independent of the capability of the tool.

Secondly, the important aspect is security. WordPress has considerable vulnerabilities unless you dare deal with them. Many people know that they can access an admin page by adding "wp-admin.php" to the URL of an index page. You may even allow the visitors to click a link to the admin page directly if you don't delete the link created by default. In contrast, Astro lets you create simple HTML files, so there is no admin page and user information, such as user ID, mail address, and password. Therefore, attackers have no means to crack your blog.

Furthermore, the speed at which visitors access your blog is crucial. Using WordPress causes a blog a bit of delay due to connection with the database, while a blog consisting of HTML and CSS files has no connection with the database. It just returns the files the visitors requested from the web server. Building a blog with Astro is the best option if you don't want visitors annoyed with loading time.

In conclusion, constructing a blog with Astro provides uncountable benefits that WordPress can't do and keeps you from being bothered to deal with the problems caused by managing a blog. It is time to learn how to build a website with Astro if you haven't considered it.
