title: Scorching Summer Was Over

The year 2024 had a deadly summer. I was boiling in extremely heated air, and sweat was running down my skin like a waterfall, even though I was just sitting. My physical power vanished after quite a short walk outside, and my mental power was almost broken by only considering the necessity of living in such a condition.
Now that it is late September, the temperature calms down, even though I still feel nasty heat inside my house. Cool breezes make me feel comfortable while walking outside. Scorching summer was finally over. It is time to do anything that the deadly summer prevented me from doing.

On my bucket list is, of course, opening windows and releasing sealed stagnant air. During summer, the air conditioner was working all day, every day. Thus, there is no room for opening the windows, and as the days went by, the air was getting staler. I want to let fresh air in and inhale the air.

Reading books while feeling a comfortable breeze and drinking hot tea is also on my bucket list. Honestly, reading books in scorching air was quite uncomfortable. My fingers were wet with sweat, and books got soft from absorbing it. Additionally, I couldn't simply concentrate on books due to heat. The best environment for reading is not being annoyed with any weather conditions and being able to relax with a cup of tea. Therefore, autumn is the best option.

Furthermore, I should not forget to enjoy nabe! Nabe is a Japanese dish that involves stewing meat and vegetables. Every autumn and winter, I rely on this food completely enough to forget what I had eaten in Summer. Nabe is very healthy and quite easy to cook. Plus, countless kinds of soup are sold. Lately, some famous ramen shops have been supervising nabe soup. Isn't it natural to rely on nabe in the cold season?

Anyway, I can forget the scorching heat for a while. Before a bone-chilling cold attacks me and keeps me at home, I will enjoy as many activities as possible.

*I should have completed this post much earlier. September is far behind me. I have been so lazy.
