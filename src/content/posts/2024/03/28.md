As I refered yesterday post, I've planned today's morning. But I couldn't get up even though I was awake completely. I didn't have courage to get up. You might doubt if it is a matter of courage. Maybe, I think that is a matter of a sort of courage.

Fortunately, I feel like I'm able to do things following my plan tonight. Not aiming all at once, I'll improve my life step by step.
