Yesterday I finished Percy Jackson book 3! It was very very very interesting and exciting and thrilling, and bittery a bit. And Nico... I'm really attracted to him.

Remembering back, when I was reading book 1, I was very suffering from unfamilar English. So it took almost one month to finish book 1. But as for book 2 and book 3, it took less than two weeks. Does it mean my English improving? Maybe, no. It means the way of Rick Riordan's writting is very sophisticated.

So, I started book 4 this morning. I already miss Percy and other charactors because I would have finish all of the books nearly soon.
