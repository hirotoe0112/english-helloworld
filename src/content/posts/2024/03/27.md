Although it was warm outside, inside home was still cold.

It was the last day of this sprint, so I had much time to write a blog.

Lately, I'm too lazy to do things that I have to and I want to, so I decided to make a plan for each day. Today, I almost did things that I have planned. I hope this remains after tomorrow.
