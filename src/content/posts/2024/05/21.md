Okay, I just do what to do. I have to study kanji. I have to learn new skills related to my job. Okay. This is my life. Okay, I'm depressed, but I simply do. This is my life. Simply live until die. That's all.

I receipt "Tweet Cute", which I ordered from Amazon a few days ago. It is heavier than I have imagined. The more I read English books, the more I eagar to read various English books.

Okay, for the rest of the day, I'm going to study kanji, and then I'm going to take a bath and do like these things. Today I can't sleep because Microsoft Build 2024 is going to be held at midnight. I'm going to be awake for all night.
