I had a piano lesson this morning. I won't have had a piano lesson until August. In the way home, I purchased some daily tools, like teeth brushes, in the drug store.

Uh, somehow I forgot how to write in English...

Anyway, after I returned home, I studied kanji as usual. It seems that everyday I write about studying kanji in this diary. Lately I don't do anything but study kanji, actually. Today I studied yojijukugo, which is the words combined with four kanji. They usually come from an episode in ancient China. I enjoy knowing the episodes, some of which are funny.

And I watched a bunch of the videos about kanji. These videos is not for the exam, but for the education. Through these videos, we can obtain the ability of teaching kanji. These videos are very fun because I can deeply learn the details of kanji.

I really forgot how to write in English... I have to read English books more and more.
