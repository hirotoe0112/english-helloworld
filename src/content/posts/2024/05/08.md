I have been thinking how I can be a good person. I want to be a useful person for someone, that is far away as I'm.

Today I went to my office. Our team had a scrum event since it was Wednesday. I was assigned to several tasks. Uh...I don't feel like writing a diary.

I'm stuck. How is going on my life? I want to be a normal person like everyone else. But how?
