I want to be back to when I wasn't completely worried about anything. To when I was just able to enjoy my hobbies. To when I was useful for someone. I want to quit everything I have to do now. I want to go somewhere far away. I want to throw away everything. Now I can't be useful for anyone but bother everyone. Totally I'm not needed by the rest of the world.

Now I have to do many things. I have to learn new skills related to my work. I have to study kanji. I have to, I have to... I want to throw up everything. I want to vanish from the world. I'm tired of everything.

I ordered a new English book on Amazon a few days ago. Since it hadn't be shipped until this evening, I felt worried about not shipping forever, so I ordered another English book this morning. As a result of that, I'm going to receive two English books tomorrow. Although it is better than not receiving any books...

I'm tired. All I'm able to do is writing my feelings here in this poor English. I'm tired. I feel writing in English is able to cover my intense feeling.
