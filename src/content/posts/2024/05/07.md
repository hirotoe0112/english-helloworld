I'd been lazy for writting this diary during Golden Week. Since today, I'm going to write this diary constantly.

Lately I'm thinking about what to read after I finished The Cobra Event. The Cobra Event is a little difficult for me, so I feel like I want to read an easier book. But I'm interested in Jeffry Archer, especially Kane And Abel. This book seems very interesting, but it contains more than 500 pages. It doesn't seem that I can read it within three weeks. I have the rule to read an English book within three weeks. Maybe I should read an easy book. But once I read The Cobra Event, a book for adult, I wonder if I'm able to be satisfied with an easy book for children.

Today I didn't strongly want to go shopping for lunch and dinner, so I used a net shopping. It was very convenient and saved much time. I ordered in the morning, and the foods arrived at noon. Isn't it an amazing service? I'm going to use it occasionally.

Lately I read the way how to memorize the Russian words for English speakers in the Russian text. According to this book, if you want to memorize the word спасибо which means thank you, you should memorize this phrase: thanking Sarah for passing the butter. Japanese people sometimes memorize some words by connecting them with other words which have similar sounds. In English, they use the same method, don't they? I was amazed at this.

Tuesday, 7 May, 2024

I had been lazy about writing this diary during Golden Week. Starting today, I am committed to writing in it regularly.

Lately, I have been contemplating what to read after finishing “The Cobra Event.” Since “The Cobra Event” is a bit challenging for me, I feel inclined towards reading an easier book. However, I am intrigued by Jeffrey Archer, especially “Kane and Abel.” This book seems very interesting, but it exceeds 500 pages. It appears unlikely that I can finish it within three weeks, which is my personal rule for reading an English book. Perhaps I should opt for an easier read. Yet, having delved into “The Cobra Event,” a book aimed at adults, I question whether a children’s book would suffice.

Today, I didn’t feel like going out to shop for lunch and dinner, so I resorted to online shopping. It was remarkably convenient and saved me a lot of time. I placed my order in the morning, and the food arrived at noon. Isn’t that a fantastic service? I plan to use it occasionally.

Recently, I came across a method for memorizing Russian words tailored for English speakers in Russian text. According to the book, to remember the word “спасибо,” which means thank you, you should associate it with the phrase “thanking Sarah for passing the butter.” Japanese individuals sometimes link words with similar sounds to memorize them. In English, do they employ the same technique? I was astonished by this revelation.
