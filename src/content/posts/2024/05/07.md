I'd been lazy for writting this diary during Golden Week. Since today, I'm going to write this diary constantly.

Lately I'm thinking about what to read after I finished The Cobra Event. The Cobra Event is a little difficult for me, so I feel like I want to read an easier book. But I'm interested in Jeffry Archer, especially Kane And Abel. This book seems very interesting, but it contains more than 500 pages. It doesn't seem that I can read it within three weeks. I have the rule to read an English book within three weeks. Maybe I should read an easy book. But once I read The Cobra Event, a book for adult, I wonder if I'm able to be satisfied with an easy book for children.

Today I didn't strongly want to go shopping for lunch and dinner, so I used a net shopping. It was very convenient and saved much time. I ordered in the morning, and the foods arrived at noon. Isn't it an amazing service? I'm going to use it occasionally.

Lately I read the way how to memorize the Russian words for English speakers in the Russian text. According to this book, if you want to memorize the word спасибо which means thank you, you should memorize this phrase: thanking Sarah for passing the butter. Japanese people sometimes memorize some words by connecting them with other words which have similar sounds. In English, they use the same method, don't they? I was amazed at this.
