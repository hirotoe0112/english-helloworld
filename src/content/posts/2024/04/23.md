I'm stuck. The speed of my reading English books is slow down. Now I'm reading The Cobra Event by Richard Preston, which is a little difficult for me. The previous book of it was very easy to read, so I expected this book is also easy. But there are too many unknown words and the structure of the sentences are complicated. I decided the rule that I read this book 20 pages per day, which so far I'm able to keep. But I will struggle soon.

Today my colleague and I dealt with a difficult task. Hardly I could help him enough, but I did what I could do. Tomorrow we will have a scrum event and I will be assigned a new task. Is it true that the more tasks I deal with, the more my skills advance?

I'm practicing typing with Russian keyboard order. I almost memorize where each keys are, but I can't type proactively as well as English keyboard order. However, I'm not supposed to type Russian so long text, so perhaps I don't need to worry about it.

I’m stuck. The speed of my reading English books has slowed down. Currently, I’m reading “The Cobra Event” by Richard Preston, which is a little difficult for me. The previous book I read was very easy, so I expected this book to be easy as well. However, there are too many unknown words, and the sentence structures are complicated. I have set a rule for myself to read 20 pages of this book per day, which I have been able to maintain so far. But I anticipate I will soon start to struggle.

Today, my colleague and I dealt with a difficult task. I could hardly help him enough, but I did what I could. Tomorrow, we will have a scrum event, and I will be assigned a new task. Is it true that the more tasks I deal with, the more my skills will advance?

I am practicing typing with the Russian keyboard layout. I have almost memorized the positions of each key, but I can’t type as quickly and fluently as with the English keyboard layout. However, since I am not expected to type long texts in Russian, perhaps I don’t need to worry about it.

#### Explanation of Corrections
1. The correct phrase is “the speed of my reading English books has slowed down” instead of “slow down” to indicate a change in speed.
2. “I expected this book to be easy” is a clearer phrasing than “I expected this book is also easy”.
3. “Tomorrow, we will have a scrum event” is a more appropriate way to structure the sentence for better flow.
4. “I can’t type as proactively as with an English keyboard layout” is a clearer way to express the idea. (complete)
