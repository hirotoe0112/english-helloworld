I can't believe that April is over... Time is passing very fast...

Today I went to my office. Before I went to, I freezed several breads which I purchased last Sunday. I had some of them for breakfast and lunch, which were very delicious.

I use GitHub Copilot to develop, which predicts the sentences that I'm going to type. During development it is very useful, but during writing diary in English, I can accidentally see what it predicts. I have the rule that I don't retrieve the spelling and the grammer during writing diary, that is inconvinient a bit. To prevent from seeing, I can't ever look at the display! I'm writing this looking at the wall.

After I returned home, I had dinner. Then I studied kanji as usual. The textbook says that if you scored less than 99, you had better give up... But I won't give up. If I continue making efforts, I would pass the exam, probably.

And I studied Russian. Today I learned Russian handwriting, which seem to be too complex. By whether there is a first stroke or not, it means different letters. I can't understand. But for Russian, perhaps Japanese is also incomprehentive.

I can’t believe that April is over… Time is passing very fast…

Today I went to my office. Before I went, I froze several breads which I purchased last Sunday. I had some of them for breakfast and lunch, which were very delicious.

I use GitHub Copilot to develop, which predicts the sentences that I’m going to type. During development, it is very useful, but when writing a diary in English, I can accidentally see what it predicts. I have the rule that I don’t correct the spelling and grammar during diary writing, which is a bit inconvenient. To prevent myself from seeing the predictions, I can’t even look at the display! I’m writing this while looking at the wall.

After I returned home, I had dinner. Then I studied kanji as usual. The textbook says that if you score less than 99, you had better give up… But I won’t give up. If I continue making efforts, I might pass the exam.

I also studied Russian today. I learned Russian handwriting, which seems to be too complex. Depending on whether there is a first stroke or not, it represents different letters. I find it difficult to understand. But for Russians, perhaps Japanese is also incomprehensible.

2. “Before I went to” should be “Before I went,” to make the sentence grammatically correct.
3. “inconvinient” should be “inconvenient,” corrected the spelling mistake.
4. “grammer” should be “grammar,” corrected the spelling error.
5. Changed “retrieve” to “correct” to better fit the context of not checking spelling or grammar.
6. “if you scored less than 99” – Replaced with “if you score less than 99” for correct verb tense.
