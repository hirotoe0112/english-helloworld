Today I should've had a piano lesson, but the teacher had gotton sick, so the lesson was canceled. I spend all day at home except for going for lunch and dinner.

I was studying kanji because I plan to take Kanken, which means an exam of kanji. Through studying that, I enjoy understanding kanji and ancient Chinese culture.

I have been reading Percy Jackson book 5. Compare with book 3 and book 4, book 5 is a little difficult for me because the depiction of the battle scene is more complex. But the story line is also brilliant. I really don't want it to end.

I watched a video about personalized nutrition provided by DW Documentary on YouTube. According the video, how affect when one person eats a certain food is depends on the person's gene. If it is true, I don't know what I should eat.
