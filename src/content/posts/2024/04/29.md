Today I watched a movie of "Detective Conan" at a theater. I hadn't been to a theater for a long time. The movie was so exciting, and after the ending, I felt missing a little.

After the movie, I had a hanburg for lunch at a restaurant near the theater. It was covered with curry sauce and cheese. Even though its caroly was very high, I was satisfied with the lunch.

Then, I went to a glossary to buy meals of dinner. I purchased some sasimi, chawanmusi, and kamaboko. Because the lunch was oily and salty, I wanted to eat healthy foods for dinner.

After I came back home, I studied kanji. I tried the second practice exam in the textbook. I got 96 scores, however the passing line of the exam is 160. Is it possible for me to pass the exam?

At night, I made word lists of Russian. I wanted to use an app to manager word lists, but I don't want to install a new app because my smart phone would be messy. So I decided to use Notion, a memo app I already use. This app has some issues when using with smart phone..., but so far, I'm goint to continue using it.

It is time for dinner, but I'm not hungry. If I have dinner so late, the time I go to bed will be also late. I have to have dinner immediately.

Monday, 29 April 2024

Today, I watched a “Detective Conan” movie at the theater. I hadn’t been to a theater in a long time. The movie was so exciting, and after it ended, I felt a bit nostalgic.

After the movie, I had a hamburger for lunch at a restaurant near the theater. It was covered with curry sauce and cheese. Despite its high calorie content, I was satisfied with the meal.

Next, I went to a grocery store to buy ingredients for dinner. I purchased some sashimi, chawanmushi, and kamaboko. Since lunch was oily and salty, I wanted to eat healthier food for dinner.

When I returned home, I studied kanji. I attempted the second practice exam in the textbook and scored 96, but the passing score for the exam is 160. I wonder if I can pass the exam.

In the evening, I created a list of Russian words. I intended to use a word list management app, but I didn’t want to clutter my smartphone with a new app. Therefore, I opted to use Notion, a memo app I already have. Although this app has some issues when used with a smartphone, I plan to continue using it.

It’s dinnertime, but I’m not hungry. If I have dinner too late, I will also go to bed late. I need to have dinner promptly.
