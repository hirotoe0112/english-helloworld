Lately I like learning something in English, so I started watching a video about Russian in English. But a problem occured. In that video, there is no script! I can't listening English completely, I struggled to understand what a teacher said. But I managed to learn Russian arphabet and basic pronounciation. Russian pronounciation is difficult for me Japanese. But I aim to read Russian books, so perphaps I don't have to worry about pronounciation very much.

Today I absolutely didn't want to make dinner. The motivation wasn't occured. But finally I reluctantly made it. I have to make more effort to do daily chores.

Anyway, it is Friday tomorrow. I want to rest.

Lately, I have been enjoying learning English, so I decided to watch a video about Russian in English. However, a problem occurred. In that video, there was no script! I couldn’t fully understand the English being spoken, and I struggled to comprehend what the teacher was saying. Despite this challenge, I managed to learn the Russian alphabet and basic pronunciation. Russian pronunciation is difficult for me as a Japanese learner. Nevertheless, my goal is to read Russian books, so perhaps I don’t have to worry too much about pronunciation.

Today, I absolutely did not want to make dinner. I lacked motivation. However, I finally made it, albeit reluctantly. I realize that I need to put more effort into doing daily chores.

Anyway, tomorrow is Friday, and I am looking forward to resting.
