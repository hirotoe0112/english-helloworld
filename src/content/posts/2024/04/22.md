Why are songs of mine such great? I'm listening to the songs that I had composed long time ago, which are absolutly great. Can't I never create such great songs? I don't want to think so. If I try composing really hard, can I create such great songs again?

Lately I'm trying to clean up inside my freezer. Today I used pork which I had freezed long time ago, so-called "ancient pork" for curry. That curry didn't taste proper curry taste... I shouldn't foods laid in the freezer so long. In the freezer, there are things which I actually don't what they are. So terrible.

Anyway, the songs of mine are really great. I can listening to them forever. I'm going to try composing again so that the number of gread songs are increased.
