I'm reading English books. I'm interested in Russian. I'm also interested in Kansi, which is Chinese poem. The common point of those is that I want to know the worlds where I don't know. I always want to know the worlds where I don't know. It might be the feeling that I want to flee.

Anyway, I have been motivated for these days. I want to know everything I don't know, I want to study much more, I want to do anything that helps other people. Un, so I can't waste time. It's time to take a bath and study Kanji and read books. I want to be an overwhelming person.
