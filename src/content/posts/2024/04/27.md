Yesterday terrible thing happend. My housemate accidentally scattered soy source all over the room. He drank so much that he didn't realize what he did, so he fell into asleep immediately. The room was full of the smell of soy source. During night, I was desperately cleaning all over the room. However, I wasn't able to find out where drops were actually scattered. The room is too messy to search. Even thought the smell was reduced with my effort, there was still faint smell.

Today I found soy source in a narrow spece on surface of a speaker. It is supporsed to be the reason of faint smell, so I managed to clean that space with plastic card. I covered that card with wet cloth and inserted it into that space. Such a hard work. I hope that the smell vanishes.

This morning I tackled new textbook of Kanji. This textbook contains 17 practice exam which format immitates a real exam. It took about 2 hours and half to finish the first one. I have to tackle rest of the textbook, which seems to be hard. But I enjoy studying Kanji.

I also tackled the Russian textbook. Although this book is written in English, it seem that I'm able to study with it except for exercises about translating Russsian to English because I'm not good at writing English.

And, I also have to keep the rule reading "The Cobra Event" 20 pages each day. There are too many things to do, but I feel fun.

Yesterday, a terrible thing happened. My housemate accidentally spilled soy sauce all over the room. He drank so much that he didn’t realize what he did, so he fell asleep immediately. The room was filled with the smell of soy sauce. During the night, I desperately cleaned all over the room. However, I wasn’t able to find out where the drops were actually scattered. The room was too messy to search. Even though the smell was reduced with my efforts, there was still a faint smell lingering.

Today, I found soy sauce in a narrow space on the surface of a speaker. It is supposed to be the reason for the faint smell, so I managed to clean that space with a plastic card. I covered the card with a wet cloth and inserted it into that space. Such hard work. I hope the smell vanishes.

This morning, I started on a new Kanji textbook. This textbook contains 17 practice exams which imitate a real exam format. It took about 2 and a half hours to finish the first one. I have to work through the rest of the textbook, which seems to be challenging. But I enjoy studying Kanji.

I also started on a Russian textbook. Although this book is written in English, it seems that I’m able to study with it except for exercises that involve translating Russian to English because I’m not good at writing in English.

Additionally, I have to continue the rule of reading “The Cobra Event” for 20 pages each day. There are so many things to do, but I’m having fun.
