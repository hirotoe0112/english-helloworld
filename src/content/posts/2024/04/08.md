At last I finished Percy Jackson book 4! It was such a wonderful and brilliant and thrilling story! And like book 3, it was bitter a bit. I'm very missing this series and characters, even though there is one more book I should read. I really really don't want this series to end.

Yesterday(this is diary, but I'm writting about yesterday), I studied very very hard. I have Google Cloud Exam on this Thursday. Besides, the exam is in English... Even I haven't covered all of the subjects this exam required... By this Wednesday, I'll study very very very harder than ever.

Today I struggled from the problem of execution speed and used memory of my program. I'm not good at dealing with such problem, but I did as long as I could. I hope I won't make a bug by my work...
