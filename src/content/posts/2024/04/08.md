At last I finished Percy Jackson book 4! It was such a wonderful and brilliant and thrilling story! And like book 3, it was bitter a bit. I'm very missing this series and characters, even though there is one more book I should read. I really really don't want this series to end.

Yesterday(this is diary, but I'm writting about yesterday), I studied very very hard. I have Google Cloud Exam on this Thursday. Besides, the exam is in English... Even I haven't covered all of the subjects this exam required... By this Wednesday, I'll study very very very harder than ever.

Today I struggled from the problem of execution speed and used memory of my program. I'm not good at dealing with such problem, but I did as long as I could. I hope I won't make a bug by my work...

At last, I finished Percy Jackson book 4! It was such a wonderful, brilliant, and thrilling story! Similar to book 3, it was a bit bittersweet. I miss this series and its characters a lot, even though I still have one more book to read. I truly don’t want this series to end.

Yesterday (even though this is a diary entry, I’m writing about yesterday), I studied very hard. I have the Google Cloud Exam on Thursday, and it’s in English… Even though I haven’t covered all the subjects required for this exam… By Wednesday, I will study even harder than ever.

Today, I struggled with the problem of execution speed and memory usage in my program. I’m not good at handling such issues, but I did my best. I hope I won’t introduce any bugs in my work.
