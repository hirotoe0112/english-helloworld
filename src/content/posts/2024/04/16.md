Today I went to my office. I spent most of time to deal with the tasks with my pair. Fortunately, we could open a pull request, so the rest of the task is being reviewed and fixing. This is normal day before the scrum event.

I'd like to study Russian language, because I'd like to read Russian books in original language. After I started to read English books, I realized that reading foreign books in original language is very delightful. I hope I can read Russian books as well. But I have studied English for more than 20 years. I'm not sure if I can do the same thing about Russian.

### Overall Comments
It seems like you have a good grasp of English. Your diary entry is well-written and engaging. Keep up the good work!

### Revised Diary
Tuesday, 16 April 2024

Today I went to my office. I spent most of the time dealing with tasks with my colleague. Fortunately, we were able to open a pull request, so the rest of the tasks are being reviewed and fixed. This is a normal day before the scrum event.

I would like to study the Russian language because I want to read Russian books in their original language. After I started reading English books, I realized that reading foreign books in the original language is very delightful. I hope I can also read Russian books. However, I have been studying English for more than 20 years, so I’m not sure if I can do the same with Russian.

### Explanation of Corrections
1. “my pair” changed to “my colleague” – “Pair” is not commonly used to refer to a co-worker in English. “Colleague” is a more appropriate term.
2. “deal with the tasks with my pair” changed to “dealing with tasks with my colleague” – The correction provides a smoother sentence structure.
3. “fixing” changed to “fixed” – In this context, it sounds more natural to use the past tense “fixed” instead of the present continuous “fixing.”
4. “I’d like to study Russian language” changed to “I would like to study the Russian language” – Adding “the” before “Russian” makes the sentence grammatically correct.
5. “because I’d like to read Russian books in original language” changed to “because I want to read Russian books in their original language” – The revised sentence provides clearer communication.
6. “But I have studied English for more than 20 years.” changed to “However, I have been studying English for more than 20 years.” – Using “have been studying” is more appropriate for describing an ongoing action. (complete)
