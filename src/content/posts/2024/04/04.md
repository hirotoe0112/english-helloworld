I'm planning to take a Google Cloud Certification in English. For that I'm learning GCP things in English. And I took several practice exams in English, so far I archived more than 70% score. But I'm very anxious to pass the exam.

By the way, in English, when I want to write year, month, day, and day of the week, don't it need to put comma between month and year?

Today I made dinner very hardly, which made me very tired. But I have to make variety of dishes to take in sufficient nutorition.

Monday, 4 April 2024

I’m planning to take a Google Cloud Certification in English. For that, I’m learning GCP concepts in English. I have also taken several practice exams in English, and so far I have achieved a score of more than 70%. However, I am feeling very anxious about passing the exam.

By the way, in English, when writing the date with the year, month, day, and day of the week, it is not necessary to put a comma between the month and year.

Today, I made dinner very carefully, which made me very tired. However, I have to prepare a variety of dishes to ensure I get sufficient nutrition.
