I'm planning to take a Google Cloud Certification in English. For that I'm learning GCP things in English. And I took several practice exams in English, so far I archived more than 70% score. But I'm very anxious to pass the exam.

By the way, in English, when I want to write year, month, day, and day of the week, don't it need to put comma between month and year?

Today I made dinner very hardly, which made me very tired. But I have to make variety of dishes to take in sufficient nutorition.
