I'm prone to being influenced by the surrounding people. Therefore, I tend to do what they expect to me rather than what I want to do. When someone questions me what I want to eat, I can't help but think "Well, I want to eat a ramen, but he/she may not want to eat it..." I have had this portrait since I was a child. Now, I don't know what I really want and want to do. I'm suffered from this. How can I restore my real desire?

I was graded high when I was a student. This doesn't necessarily mean that I'm smart. Obtaining high score on the paper tests is different from acting as a good social person. Parents are bothered with their children's grades, but I insist that the grades were definitely not relevant to their children's social success. Although high-graded children are likely to success, it merely happen by chance. I want parents to focus on children's indivisual personality and to respect their desire. Studying at a school is just a part of humanity life.

I may regret my life. I had a lot of turning points in my life, and I think I made a best choice at each point. However, were they really right? I don't think so.

I’m prone to being influenced by the people around me. Therefore, I tend to do what they expect of me rather than what I truly want to do. When someone asks me what I want to eat, I can’t help but think, “Well, I want to eat ramen, but he/she may not want to eat it…” This trait has been with me since I was a child. Now, I find myself unsure of my own desires and goals. I am struggling with this. How can I rediscover my true desires?

I excelled academically when I was a student. However, being graded highly does not necessarily mean I am intelligent. Achieving high scores on tests does not equate to being a good social person. Parents often emphasize their children’s grades, but I believe that grades do not determine a child’s social success. While high-achieving children may have a higher likelihood of success, it is not guaranteed. I urge parents to focus on their children’s individual personalities and to respect their aspirations. Education is only a part of human life.

I may have regrets about my life. I have encountered many turning points in my life, and I believed I made the best choices at each juncture. But upon reflection, were they truly the right decisions? I am beginning to doubt that they were.
