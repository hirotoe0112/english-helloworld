I obtained a book about English writing which I ordered yesterday. Japanese people can usually read English well, but as for writing, quite a few Japanese would make mistakes. They, including me, write English sentences the way they write Japanese sentences. These sentences are likely to sound unnaturally for native English speakers.

The book instruct how to write natural English sentences. For example, Japanese people often use the phrase "there is...", but English people use other phrases, which are more natural, to express the same meaning. The author show the readers a lot of similar examples. The book will lead my English writing skill to the next level.

I'm not going to take a TOEFL exam, but I will study English as if I took it. The reason of that is that it may be the best way to improve my English skills such as reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Having high skills will make me easier to read English books and English articles, which I sometimes need to read at work, and watch online sessions held in foreign countries. My whole life will be more enjoyable with high level English skills. Therefore, I will keep studying.

### Revised Diary
Tuesday, 6 August, 2024

I received the English writing book that I ordered yesterday. While Japanese people can usually read English well, many of us, including myself, struggle with writing in English. We tend to structure English sentences the same way we would in Japanese, resulting in sentences that sound unnatural to native English speakers.

The book teaches how to compose natural English sentences. For instance, Japanese speakers often rely on the phrase “there is…”, whereas English speakers use more natural expressions to convey the same meaning. The author provides numerous similar examples to guide the readers. This book will elevate my English writing skills to the next level.

Although I do not plan on taking the TOEFL exam, I am approaching my English studies as if I were preparing for it. I believe this is the most effective method to enhance my reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. Improving these skills will make it easier for me to read English books and articles, which are sometimes necessary for work, and to participate in online sessions conducted in foreign countries. Acquiring advanced English proficiency will undoubtedly enrich my life, so I am committed to continuous learning.
