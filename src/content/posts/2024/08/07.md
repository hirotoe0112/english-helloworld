I'm reading "The Red Zone" by Richard Preston. I have already read two books written by him. I thought "The Hot Zone" was pretty easy for non-native speakers to read, and "The Red Zone" is the following book of "The Hot Zone". However, I struggle to read "The Red Zone". I feel it more difficult than "The Hot Zone". Considering my rule of reading a English book within three weeks, I have to finish reading it by the next Saturday. The rule may fail for the first time... I'll do best for promise my rule, but I also have to study kanji, English, and Google Cloud... How can I generate spare time?

Today my colleagues discussed the setting of the air conditioner. Most of them set it over 26 degrees, which astonished me. Actually I set my air conditioner at 29 degrees. I assumed that others set lower degrees.

I read a textbook considering English writing, but in this diary, my writing is definitely poor. Although I understand the importance of practice, but poor writing depress me. I'll make an effort to improve writing. I have another rule to write this diary over 200 words, but sometimes I can't. The reason of that is that I don't have what to write, in addition I don't know how I can write what I want to. This diary already exceed 200 words, so I quit writing here.
