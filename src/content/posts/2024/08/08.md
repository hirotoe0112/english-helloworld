Since I'll devote my spared time to read "Crisis In The Red Zone" today, I let this diary be short.

This morning I tackled interpreting English sentences. When unknown words appeared, I retrieved the meanings, meanwhile I usually remain them unknown during reading an English book. This action will help me comprehend the sentence deeply. I'll keep up it.

I couldn't study kanji because I was worried about earthquake forecasting. Tomorrow I'll make much effort.
