My laziness makes me almost abandon this diary. I'm going to resume this from today.

Recently I'm very motivated to learn a lot of subject. Studying kanji is one of them. In addition to, I start studying English. The reason is that I decided to apply for an university in America. Actually, I finished the admission procedure, and I'm waiting for the contact from the university. However, my English skill is not enough to study at American university. I have been reading English books for over 1 year, yet my vocabulary is too poor to read textbooks for lectures and write essays. There is 1 month before the first term starts. I'm going to improve my English skill as much as possible.

Furthermore, I started studying math. For many years I've wanted to study math, but I couldn't afford it. However, the time for studying need to be generated by myself. I'm going to make time for studying with getting up early, for example.

I'm studying Google Cloud, too. I applied for the exam, therefore I need to study. To prepare for the exam, I purchased an online course on Coursera. Not make the money worthless, I should complete the course and pass the exam. I have a lot of things to do. I hope my motivation will keep for a long time.
