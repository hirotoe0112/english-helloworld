My laziness makes me almost abandon this diary. I'm going to resume this from today.

Recently I'm very motivated to learn a lot of subject. Studying kanji is one of them. In addition to, I start studying English. The reason is that I decided to apply for an university in America. Actually, I finished the admission procedure, and I'm waiting for the contact from the university. However, my English skill is not enough to study at American university. I have been reading English books for over 1 year, yet my vocabulary is too poor to read textbooks for lectures and write essays. There is 1 month before the first term starts. I'm going to improve my English skill as much as possible.

Furthermore, I started studying math. For many years I've wanted to study math, but I couldn't afford it. However, the time for studying need to be generated by myself. I'm going to make time for studying with getting up early, for example.

I'm studying Google Cloud, too. I applied for the exam, therefore I need to study. To prepare for the exam, I purchased an online course on Coursera. Not make the money worthless, I should complete the course and pass the exam. I have a lot of things to do. I hope my motivation will keep for a long time.

### Overall Comments
Great job on your diary! You have a clear goal and a plan to achieve it, which is very commendable. Make sure to pay attention to your grammar and word choices to improve the overall quality of your writing.

### Revised Diary
Monday, 5 August, 2024

My laziness almost led me to abandon this diary. I have decided to resume writing in it starting today.

Lately, I have been very motivated to learn various subjects. One of them is studying kanji. In addition, I have started studying English. The reason for this is that I have decided to apply to a university in America. I have already completed the admission procedures and am now waiting to hear from the university. However, my English skills are not sufficient for studying at an American university. Despite having read English books for over a year, my vocabulary is still too limited to comprehend textbooks for lectures and to write essays. With only one month left before the first term begins, I am determined to improve my English skills as much as possible.

Moreover, I have also started studying math. I have wanted to study math for many years, but I was unable to do so before due to financial constraints. Now, I realize that I need to create the time for studying on my own. I plan to make time by waking up early, for example.

I am also delving into Google Cloud. I have applied for an exam, and therefore, I need to study for it. To prepare, I have purchased an online course on Coursera. In order to make the most of the money spent, I am committed to completing the course and passing the exam. I have a lot on my plate, but I hope to maintain my motivation for a long time.
