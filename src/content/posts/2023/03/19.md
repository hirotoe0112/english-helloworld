It is very sunny today. I feel like walking out.

I went to go a spicy ramen shop. I like this ramen. It was very delicious.

Then, I went to a book store. I bought a book related my work. I want to improve my ability.

After I wrote this diary, I’m going to study math. I’ll have an exam next month.

## AI-based editing results
以下が修正点です。

「I feel like walking out.」は、「外に出たい気がする」という意味で、適切な表現ですが、「I feel like going for a walk.」の方が、より自然な表現となります。
「I went to go a spicy ramen shop.」の「go」は不要です。「I went to a spicy ramen shop.」と書きましょう。
「related my work」は、「related to my work」の方が正しい表現です。
最後の文は、「After writing this diary, I’m going to study math. I have an exam next month.」と書くとより自然です。「After I wrote this diary」と書いた場合、「After I wrote this diary, I found out that I had made some mistakes.」など、ある一定の時間が経過したことを表現する際に使用されます。
以上の修正を加えると、より自然な英文になります。
