It was sunny and warm. Cherry blossoms is blooming.

I bought some English books because English teacher recommended me to read English books. I’m looking forward to try reading them.

Today I finished some task at work. I could solve problems with my coworkers. I feel good.

I’m going to study math tonight. I have an exam two weeks later.

【修正理由】

日付の書き方を「Thursday, March 30, 2023」と修正しました。
花の「cherry blossoms」を単数形の「cherry blossom」と修正しました。
tryの後に動詞が来る場合、動詞の原形を用います。また、readingの前に冠詞が必要なので「to trying to read them」と修正しました。
taskは複数形なので「tasks」に修正しました。
数学を勉強するのは「because」が適切なので、文法的な修正をしました。
