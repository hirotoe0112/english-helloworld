Hi! It is a post after a long time…. I joined the new company and I’m working with new coworkers.

I feel good because It’s getting warmer.

I take online English lessons recently, but I still can’t speak English well. So, I should study English study now and have oppotunities for output. I want not only to study English but also use English.

By the way, I study math recently too. I’m very busy….

Hi! It’s been a while since my last post. I have recently joined a new company and am working with new coworkers. I feel good because the weather is getting warmer.

I have been taking online English lessons recently, but I still struggle with speaking English fluently. Therefore, I need to focus on practicing and seek opportunities for speaking. I not only want to study English but also use it in real-life situations.

By the way, I have also been studying math recently, so I am very busy these days.

Overall, the entry is well-written and easy to understand. However, there are a few minor mistakes and awkward phrasing that I have corrected for clarity. Good job and keep writing!

Hi! It is a post after a long time…. → Hi! It’s been a while since my last post.
「It is a post after a long time」は、日本語の直訳で、英語の文法としては不自然です。代わりに、よく使われる表現として「It’s been a while since (前回の行動)」があります。この表現を使うことで、自然な英語の日常会話を表現することができます。

最初の文は、現在進行形で「I take」と書かれていますが、日記の文脈から考えると、過去のことを指す「I have been taking」の方が適切です。また、「can’t speak English well」は、直訳的な表現で、もっと自然な表現として「struggle with speaking English fluently」があります。さらに、「opportunities for output」は日本語から直訳された表現で、代わりに「seek opportunities for speaking」と言うと自然な表現になります。「want not only to study English but also use English」は、英語としては正しいですが、もう少し自然な表現として「not only want to study English, but also want to use it in real-life situations」と言うとより自然になります。

「By the way, I study math recently too.」は、現在進行形の表現で、文脈から考えると「have been studying math recently」の方が適切です。また、「I’m very busy….」は、日本語的な表現で、英語の場合は「so I am very busy these days」のように、原因となる文を付け足すと自然な表現になります。
