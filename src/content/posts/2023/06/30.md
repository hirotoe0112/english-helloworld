It was very hot today.

Today I understood the mean of ‘convey’! ChatGPT taught me. I became to be able to make a sentence using ‘convey’. For example… Her behavior conveys that she is nervious.

I have a piano lesson tomorrow. It’s time to practice.

It was scorching hot today.

Today, I understood the meaning of ‘convey’! ChatGPT taught me. Now I am able to construct sentences using ‘convey’. For example… Her behavior conveys that she is nervous.

I have a piano lesson tomorrow. It’s time to practice.

【添削と解説】

“It was very hot today.”を “It was scorching hot today.”に変えました。ここでの”scorching”は「灼熱の」という意味で、より強い暑さを表現しています。
“mean”は「意味」という意味なので、「the mean of ‘convey'”ではなく、「the meaning of ‘convey’」が正しいです。
“I became to be able to make a sentence”の部分は少し不自然です。代わりに”I am now able to construct sentences”と言い換えました。
“nervious”のスペルは正しくは”nervous”です。
“It’s time to practice.”のままですが、この部分は正しいです。
