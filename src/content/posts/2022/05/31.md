It was rainy in the morning, but then it cleaned up in the afternoon.

I was interviewed by phone after I finished work. I heard a lot of kinds of jobs.

After returning home, I had handmade sandwich for dinner. I was so full.

### Corrections
It was raining in the morning, but it was sunny in the afternoon.

After work, I had a telephone interview, where I heard about many jobs.

After I got home, I made myself a sandwich for dinner. Iâ€™m full.
