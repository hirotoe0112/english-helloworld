It was very sunny today. It was too hot to wear long-sleeve shirt.

I don’t have lunch weekday because I become sleepy if I have lunch. After work today, I was so hungry that I ate a snack.

I signed up a few job search sites. I wish I got a good job.

## Corrections
It was very sunny today. It was too hot to wear a long sleeve shirt.

I don’t have lunch on weekdays because lunch makes me sleepy. After work today, I ate some snacks because I was hungry.

I registered on a couple of job search sites. I hope I can find a good job.
