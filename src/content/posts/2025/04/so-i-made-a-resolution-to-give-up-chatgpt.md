title: So I Made a Resolution to Give Up ChatGPT

In late April, the day a sense of summer was creeping in, I made a resolution to give up ChatGPT.

I had been producing a lot of English passages, at least for me, as an English learner, a college student, and a blogger. Most of them had eventually passed through ChatGPTâ€™s filter, being reborn as perfect forms.

And what? What stayed with me?

It was true that the passages had enough quality to obtain high grades. It was true that I had been pleased with the flawless, good-looking articles posted on my website.

And what? Could I truly say I was a writer with sheer confidence?

No.

If I were paid as a professional writer, if quickly publishing a lot of high-quality articles really mattered, I would have to treat ChatGPT as my right hand to spare my time for parties.

But I am not. I am not a professional writer. I am just an amateur, incomplete writer with a poor vocabulary. I cannot complete even one short sentence without introducing any grammatical issues. I cannot find just a word saying what I want to say without straying across a dictionary for hours.

I have enjoyed all of that. It is a delight to express what I feel, struggling with everything all writers would struggle with. Decorating my website with perfect, brilliant, and AI-made articles is not my wish. Poor, stupid, but genuine articles like this that I want to create.

So I made a resolution to give up ChatGPT.

I would feel anxious with the loneliness that I have to confront all the challenges the writing process can cause. I would be tempted to talk to ChatGPT again. But all I have to do is that I brace myself.

Be authentic. I am a writer.
